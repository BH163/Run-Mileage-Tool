# Run-Mileage-Tool
This program creates running mileage goals and helps users to track their weekly mileage.
Weekly mileage goals are established by following the standard 10-Percent Rule (10PR) for mileage building. 
When establishing a running goal's calendar, user's are prompted to enter their current weekly mileage
in addition to a goal weekly mileage. From this information, the calendar can be generated and saved to a file.
When tracking weekly mileage, user's will be able to update their calendar to reflect the ammount of miles 
ran over the week.
